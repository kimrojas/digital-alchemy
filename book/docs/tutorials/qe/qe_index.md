# Quantum Espresso with ASE

Quantum Espresso (QE) is a widely used package for electronic structure calculations. It is a suite of programs that can perform electronic structure calculations on solid state, molecules, and nanostructures. ASE provides a simple interface to Quantum Espresso, allowing you to run calculations with Quantum Espresso from Python scripts.
